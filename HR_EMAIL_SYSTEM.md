# 👔 HR Email System - LeaveEase

## 🎯 **What's New**

Your LeaveEase system now sends emails **from the HR's actual email account**! When HR approves or rejects a leave request, the employee receives an email that appears to come directly from the HR person who made the decision.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Before (Old System):**
- System email → Employee email
- Generic sender address
- No personal connection

### **After (New System):**
- HR's email → Employee email (personal)
- HR's name in signature
- Reply-to shows HR's email
- Authentic communication

## 📧 **Email Features**

### **✅ What Employees Will See:**

1. **From Address**: `hr.person@company.com` (HR's actual email)
2. **Reply-To**: `hr.person@company.com` (HR's email for replies)
3. **Subject**: `✅ Leave Request Approved - [Leave Type]` or `❌ Leave Request Rejected - [Leave Type]`
4. **Signature**: HR's name and contact information
5. **Content**: Personalized with employee details and HR's personal touch

### **📋 Email Content Includes:**

**For Approval:**
- ✅ Green success header
